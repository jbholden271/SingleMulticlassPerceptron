# SingleMulticlassPerceptron
Python implementation of a single multiclass perceptron.

This script trains a single multi class perceptron over up to 1000 iterations. The data used to test it was Matthew Ratttigan's mirror of the UCI Wine dataset. The data is also first standardized to improve the separability of the data.
